All documentation is the same, except for a few differences:

There is a timer handler.  It fires off every second, so use the modulus
operator to determine your interval.  See module_twitter.py for an example.

Speaking of which, there are Tumblr and Twitter modules.  module_tumblr uses
my fork of python-tumblr, available at http://github.com/lysol/pymblr. 
module_twitter uses the twyt project (http://andrewprice.me.uk/projects/twyt/)
to communicate with twitter.

module_tumblr commands:

  quote user (tags)
  ex: quote lysol #python #irc

  Posts a quote of the last thing said by user to Tumblr, with IRC formatting.


  quote startingline numberoflines
  ex: 

  <person1> something
  <person2> something else
  <lysol> quote 2 2
  ( would post the exchange between person1 and 2 to Tumblr )

  Posts a quote of an exchange from IRC to tumblr, starting at the first
  number of lines back, and quoting the second argument number of lines.
  


  handle_url
  
  Automatically posts all URLs to Tumblr, with the automatic type detection
  used by pymblr.



module_twitter commands:

  twit post
  ex: twit @douglbutt I really enjoyed your time in Austin, TX.

  Posts to twitter.  Nothing special here.


  sup user
  ex: sup douglbutt

  Retrieves the current status of a user.


  quote user (hashtags)
  ex: quote lysol #antglove

  Posts the last thing said by a user to twitter.  The user is not attributed.
  If you supply hashtags, they will be added to the quote.



Other features added:

  A builtin channel log is available in the modules at bot.channel_log.
  See module_tumblr or module_twitter for examples of their use.  It's
  kinda clunky and might change a little in the future.
